# Algorithms practice
## This is a repository of selected algorithms in Algorithms Class that I am implementing for practice
### The first program is ```sieve.py```
```sieve.py``` utilizes a basic algorithm to find all primes from 0 to 100
### The second program is ```euclids.py```
```euclids.py``` utilizes euclids algorithm to find the gcd between two integers
